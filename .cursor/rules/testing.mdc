# Testing Guidelines

## Vitest Testing

- Write Vitest tests for utilities and hooks
- Test components with proper mocking
- Follow testing best practices

## Component Testing

- Test components with proper mocking
- Test user interactions and edge cases
- Mock external dependencies appropriately

## Test Organization

- Organize tests alongside source files or in `__tests__` directories
- Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested
- Group related tests using `describe` blocks

## Mocking

- Mock external dependencies appropriately
- Mock API calls and external services
- Use Vitest's mocking utilities effectively

## Test Coverage

- Aim for good test coverage of critical paths
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Test both happy paths and error scenarios

## Best Practices

- Keep tests focused and isolated
- Use proper setup and teardown
- Clean up after tests
- Test behavior, not implementation details
