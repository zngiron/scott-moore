# Accessibility Guidelines

Accessibility is important. Always include:

## ARIA Attributes

- Proper ARIA attributes (`aria-label`, `aria-describedby`, `aria-hidden`, etc.)
- Use ARIA attributes when semantic HTML is not sufficient
- Ensure ARIA attributes are properly associated with elements

## Keyboard Navigation

- Keyboard navigation support (tab order, focus management)
- Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- Provide proper focus management for modals and dynamic content

## Semantic HTML

- Use semantic HTML elements (`<button>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, etc.)
- Use appropriate heading hierarchy (h1, h2, h3, etc.)
- Use proper form labels and associations

## Focus Management

- Proper focus management for modals and dynamic content
- Ensure focus is trapped in modals
- Return focus to trigger element when closing modals

## Images

- Alt text for images (descriptive, not redundant)
- Decorative images should have empty alt text: `alt=""`
- Informative images should have descriptive alt text

## Color and Contrast

- Color contrast that meets WCAG standards (use semantic color tokens)
- Don't rely solely on color to convey information
- Ensure sufficient contrast ratios (minimum 4.5:1 for text)

## Screen Readers

- Screen reader friendly markup
- Use proper landmarks and regions
- Ensure content is announced correctly by screen readers
